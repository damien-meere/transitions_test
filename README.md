This project works with transitions & Animations. 

In the main.css file, we set a number of transition properties on a div,
to change the colour and width when the object is hovered over.

In the fun.css file, we work with animation properties to apply changes to 
the div element.

In the jump.css file, we alternate a number of object properties, space from 
the top of the page, size, colour. Appearence of bouncing ball.
